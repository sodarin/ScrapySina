Onlinelearning is booming all around the world. It is providing many options withlearners in terms of time, locations, subjects and costs. Online learning greatly promoteslearners’ studying efficiency and teachers’ productivity. As a result, updatedknowledge will reach those students in isolated areas at a higher speed, whichcan make many of them keep pace with the time. Additionally, students candecide their learning location and time much more freely. Notably, because transportationand accommodation will not trouble E-learners, learning cost will be largelylowered. These advantages might decrease the number of people who routinelyattend school learning. From my point of view, personal interactionbetween teachers and students in schools is irreplaceable. It is a good ideathat we combine E-learning and attending school together. Learning is not asimple multiple-choice question but an important issue that needs your tryingand involvement.
