　　文字稿　　一座仅为人居住数月即被烧毁的古村落如今被称作“英国的庞贝古城”。科学家在分析建造村庄的木材后发现，在大火前，人们只在此生活了很短的一段时间。考古学家说，该遗址将帮助我们更深入地了解青铜时代生活的点点滴滴。请听 Tim Muffett 的报道。　　Complete sets of pottery, razors, weaving equipment, the Bronze Age settlement discovered by archaeologists in Cambridgeshire was more prosperous than many had ever envisaged.　　Five wooden houses are thought to have collapsed into a river, following a fire 3,000 years ago. Fragments were first discovered by diggers being used in a clay quarry. A 10-month excavation has now almost finished. It's revealed the largest collection of Bronze Age fibres and fabrics ever found in the UK and an array of household objects – tweezers, chisels, buckets and bowls – some still containing remnants of food from prehistoric Britain.　　Historians say it's revealed Bronze Age houses to be far better equipped than many had predicted.　　词汇表　　weaving 纺织的，织布的　　Bronze Age 青铜时代　　settlement 定居地，（人口稀少的）村落　　envisaged （过去完成时）预想，设想　　diggers 挖掘机　　excavation 发掘工程，挖掘工作　　chisels 凿子　　tweezers 镊子　　prehistoric 史前的　　equipped （工具、设施等）配备齐全的 　　测验　　请听报道并回答下列问题。　　1.
